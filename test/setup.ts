/* This setup runs once before each test file

 *Runs in the same context as test files.  Anything declared globally in 
 these files, such as global variables or mock implementations, will be available 
 to the tests.
  
 *Ideal for setting up polyfills, global mocks, or other global objects that need to be available for all test files.
